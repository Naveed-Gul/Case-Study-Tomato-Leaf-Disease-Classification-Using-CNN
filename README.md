# Case Study: Tomato Leaf Disease Classification using CNN

**Project Overview**

This project aims to classify tomato leaf diseases using machine learning techniques. The dataset contains images of tomato leaves, labeled with 10 different disease categories, which are used to train a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The model leverages techniques like Batch Normalization, Dropout, and Data Augmentation to improve accuracy and prevent overfitting. The goal is to build an automated system capable of detecting and categorizing tomato leaf diseases, which can be beneficial for farmers and agronomists to manage crops efficiently.

**Dataset**

The dataset used for this project is the Tomato Leaf Disease Dataset, which is available on Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/naveedgull/tomato-leaf-disease

The dataset is divided into:

**Training Set (80%):** Contains images for training the model.

**Test Set (20%):** Contains images for evaluating the model's performance.

**Classes in the Dataset:**

Bacterial Spot, Early Blight, Healthy, Late Blight, Leaf Mold, Septoria Leaf Spot, Spider Mites, Target Spot, Tomato Mosaic Virus, Tomato Yellow Leaf Curl Virus.
